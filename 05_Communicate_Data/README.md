# Communicate Data findings Project 
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, we will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset(*Ford GoBike System Data Flights*), starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, we will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. 

## Ford GoBike System Data Flights Dataset  
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
