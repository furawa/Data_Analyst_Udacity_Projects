# WRANGLE AND ANALYZE DATA  

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will make a data wrangling. we will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).  
The dataset that we will be wrangling, analyze and visualyze is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. We will also download additional data via the twitter API.
