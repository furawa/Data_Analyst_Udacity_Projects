# Investigate a Dataset 
In this project we will analyze 5 common types of cancer in Men from 1990 to 2016, see their evolution over years, brainstorming what questions we could answer using the data. We are not going to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, so our findings will be just tentative.
